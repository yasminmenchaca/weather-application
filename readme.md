# Weather Application

Developed an interactive forecast application which utilized OpenWeatherMap and Mapbox APIs together with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to display a five-day weather forecast. Allows users to drag and drop a map pin or enter their desired location into a search box with built-in geocoding and reverse geocoding.
